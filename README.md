**Google Play Store Apps Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

This repository explores a dataset of Google Play Store apps using Python for data analysis. Through this project, you'll gain valuable insights into the Android app market.

**Project Goals**

  * Understand the characteristics of popular and successful apps on the Google Play Store.
  * Identify trends and patterns in app ratings, categories, and other key features.
  * Gain practical experience with data analysis techniques like data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation.

**Data Source**

This project utilizes a publicly available dataset of Google Play Store apps, potentially obtained from Kaggle or another reputable source. The specific dataset details will be documented in the `data` directory.

**Required Libraries**

  * **pandas**: Powerful and versatile library for data manipulation ([https://pandas.pydata.org/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://pandas.pydata.org/))
  * **numpy**: Foundation for numerical computing ([https://numpy.org/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://numpy.org/))
  * **matplotlib**: Library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations ([https://matplotlib.org/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://matplotlib.org/))
  * **seaborn**: High-level interface for statistical data visualization built on top of matplotlib ([https://seaborn.pydata.org/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://seaborn.pydata.org/))

**Getting Started**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abhi3147/Google-Play-Data-Analysis.git
    ```

2.  **Install Required Libraries:**

      - Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies (highly recommended).
      - Install the libraries using a package manager like pip:
        ```bash
        pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
        ```

3.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

      - Open a terminal in the project directory.
      - Start a Jupyter Notebook server:
        ```bash
        jupyter notebook
        ```
      - In your web browser, navigate to `http://localhost:8888` or the appropriate URL displayed in the terminal.
      - Open the provided Jupyter Notebook (e.g., `googleplaystore_eda.ipynb`) and follow the instructions within.

**Project Structure**

  * **data**: This directory will contain the Google Play Store apps dataset (`.csv` format is recommended).
  * **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks containing the data analysis code. You can add additional notebooks for exploration.
  * **README.md** (This file)
  * **requirements.txt** (Optional): A file listing the required Python libraries and their versions. This simplifies dependency management for others.
